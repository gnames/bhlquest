INTRODUCTION 

Federal responsibilities for stewardship of the Nation's diverse and valuable 
 fishery resources date from 1871 when Congress established the position of 
 Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries in response to concerns about the decline 
 in domestic food fish supplies. In 1872, Congress appropriated funds for the 
 first national fish hatchery - a spawning and egg collecting station on the 
 McCloud River in California. During its early years, the National Fish 
 Hatchery System was the principal management tool available for addressing 
 fishery resource problems. However, changing resource needs, involving 
 management philosophies, growth of the science and technology of fishery 
 management, development of State capabilities, and legislative actions have 
 significantly altered fishery resource management and the role of the 
 National Fish Hatchery System. 

Fishery-related activities of the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) were 
 re-evaluated in the early 1980s which resulted in the definition of the 
 following four areas for which the Service has or shares responsibility: 

1. Facilitate restoration of depleted, nationally significant 
 fishery resources; 

2. seek and provide for mitigation of fishery resource impairment 
 due to Federal water-related development; 

3. assist with the management of fishery resources on Federal 
 (primarily Service) and Indian lands; and 

4. maintain a Federal leadership role in scientifically-based 
 management of national fishery resources. 

Consequently, fish culture facilities that had produced fish for enhancement 
 purposes were redirected to address the four areas of responsibility listed 
 above . 

In order to meet these responsibilities in Fiscal Year 1986, the Service 
 operated 90 fish production and support facilities that comprise the National 
 Fish Hatchery System (see pages 53 through 58). Seventy-three of these units 
 are solely fish production units, 3 of which are also classified as National 
 Broodstock Hatcheries. In addition to the 7"^ production units, the Service 
 operates 5 fish technology centers C4 of which have production responsi- 
 bilities), 10 fish health centers/offices, 1 fishway facility, and 1 fish 
 screen facility as part of the National Fish Hatchery System. 

This report summarizes the distribution of fish and fish eggs reared by 
 the National Fish Hatchery System for the period October 1, 1985, through 
 September 30, 1986.
